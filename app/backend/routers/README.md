It is recommended to use FastAPI to create REST APIs and not dynamic websites.
A proper fronend which is capable of making the REST api calls + FastAPI is recommented instead of the approach I made here.
to remove the routers part in the future, first delete the routers folder and remove the 'frontend_routers' from the main.py
